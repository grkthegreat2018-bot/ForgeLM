"""MoE inference optimizations: Alloc-MoE, Elbow routing, LDA.

Based on three 2026 papers:
  1. Alloc-MoE (ACL 2026): budget-aware expert activation allocation.
     Layer-level (Alloc-L) + token-level (Alloc-T) optimization.
     1.15× prefill, 1.34× decode at half budget.
  2. Elbow-based MoE Routing (arXiv 2608.04401): training-free inference-time
     dynamic top-k. Identifies elbow point in sorted router probabilities.
     5.3% latency reduction while maintaining accuracy.
  3. LDA Distribution-Consistent Inference (OpenReview 2026): layer-wise
     distribution alignment for reduced routing. Corrects RMS scale/variance
     mismatch when activating fewer experts.

For our model: LFM2.5-1.2B is dense (not MoE), but these techniques apply to:
  - Future MoE expansion of the model
  - Self-play expert baking (AirMoE)
  - MoD router (Mixture-of-Depths) optimization
