"""Infinite Curriculum Engine — AZR-style self-play task generation.

Implements the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) paradigm:
  - The model PROPOSES coding tasks with unit tests
  - A Python executor VERIFIES (ground truth, not model judgment)
  - Goldilocks difficulty: proposer rewarded when solver succeeds 40-60%
  - Three reasoning modes: deduction, abduction, induction
  - Infinite, adaptive curriculum — never runs out of questions

Architecture:
  1. Proposer: model generates (task_description, function_signature, test_cases)
  2. Validator: Python executor checks that test_cases are self-consistent
     (reference solution passes all tests — filters garbage proposals)
  3. Solver: model solves the task (existing self-play infrastructure)
  4. Difficulty tracker: per-domain rolling success rate
     - >60% success → proposer must generate harder tasks
     - <40% success → proposer must generate easier tasks
  5. Task queue: validated tasks stored for replay and curriculum ordering

Research basis:
  - AZR (NeurIPS 2025): zero-data SOTA via propose-solve-verify loop
  - SQLM (2025): asymmetric self-play, Goldilocks reward
  - SPICE (Meta FAIR, 2025): corpus grounding prevents collapse
  - SOAR (2026): reward = measured improvement, not intrinsic proxy

Usage:
    from forge.self_play.infinite_curriculum import InfiniteCurriculum
    curriculum = InfiniteCurriculum(model, tokenizer, device="cuda")
    tasks = curriculum.propose_tasks(domain="algorithms", n=10)
    for task in tasks:
        result = curriculum.solve_task(task)
        curriculum.record_result(task, result["success"])
