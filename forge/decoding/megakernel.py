"""Megakernel-style decode: single-graph decode for batch=1.

A true megakernel fuses ALL transformer layers into a single CUDA kernel,
eliminating all inter-kernel HBM round-trips. This is extremely complex to
write from scratch (requires handling all layer types, RoPE, RMSNorm, etc.
in one kernel).

This module provides a practical approximation: **CUDA graph capture of the
entire decode step** (all layers in one graph replay), combined with
torch.compile(fullgraph=True) for kernel fusion within each layer.

Benefits over standard CUDA graph capture:
  1. Captures the ENTIRE model forward (all 16 layers) in one graph —
     not just one layer at a time.
  2. Uses torch.compile with mode="max-autotune" to fuse operations
     within each layer (RMSNorm + RoPE + QK-norm → single kernel).
  3. Static input buffers avoid any Python overhead during replay.
  4. Single graph launch per token (vs N kernel launches per token).

Expected speedup: 1.5-3× over eager decode for small models where
launch overhead dominates (1.2B params, batch=1).

For a TRUE single-kernel megakernel (like mini-vllm's 5× speedup),
a custom Triton/CUDA kernel would be needed — this is the infrastructure
for that, with the graph-capture approximation as the first step.
